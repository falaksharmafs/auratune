## Noisy environment + music
- Detected: noise=`noisy`, content=`music`, ambient=-22.0 dB
- Deltas: {'volume_db': 0.0, 'bass_gain_db': -0.26, 'presence_gain_db': 0.0, 'treble_gain_db': -0.52}
- Genre (local ML, gradient_boosting): `chill_ambient` (74% confidence)
- Explanation: "Because of a noisy environment during music, I pulled bass back 0.3 dB, warmed treble by 0.5 dB. Sounds like chill/ambient (74% confidence, local gradient_boosting model), so I leaned the curve that way."

- Deltas: {'volume_db': 0.0, 'bass_gain_db': -1.0, 'presence_gain_db': 1.0, 'treble_gain_db': 0.0}
