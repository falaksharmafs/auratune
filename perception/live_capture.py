Live audio capture.

perception/synth_scenarios.py generates fake ambient + content audio to
stand in for a real microphone + media player in the demo. This module is
the real thing: capture a short buffer from the system's default
microphone using `sounddevice`, for a live deployment.

It's a clean drop-in swap -- everything downstream (context_classifier,
the agent pipeline, the DSP engine) takes a numpy array + sample rate and
doesn't care where it came from, so nothing else needs to change once this
works.

TODO(you): implement `record_ambient` below. See the inline TODOs.
Content audio (what's actually playing) is intentionally out of scope here
-- capturing "currently playing" audio needs OS-level loopback/virtual
audio cable setup that's much more platform-specific; ambient mic capture
alone is a genuinely useful, self-contained slice.
